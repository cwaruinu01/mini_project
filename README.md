This is a registration form that implements CRUD using Django.It can create,delete,read and update individual users.
The details of the registration form are the name ,email and age.
When an HTTP request is made to the Django website, Django's URL dispatcher is responsible for analyzing the requested URL and determining which view function should handle it. 
This process involves matching the requested URL against the URL patterns defined in the project's urls.py file. 
The app's urls.py maps to a view function defined within the same app's views.py. 
Views.py defines view functions, which handle incoming web requests and return web responses.They retrieve data from a database, process user input, and renders templates to generate HTML responses.
the templates folder holds all the templates/HTML files that are displayed to a user after the views.py renders them.
Models.py defines the structure of your database tables, including fields, relationships, and methods for interacting with the data.
The static folder is where one stores static files needed for the website's design and functionality which includes CSS stylesheets and images.
